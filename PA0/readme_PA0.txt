3. Nerdy fact : 
To identify which telescope has captured an image of space, look at the stars. If the stars have 4 spikes in a cross, then its from Hubble. If they have 6 long eqidistant spikes and 2 tiny spikes in the center, the image is from James Webb telescope. 
The spikes are called diffraction spikes.
